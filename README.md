The second website I was asked to make for my T Level Course. This is the scenario I was given:

The software development company you work for has secured a new contract to develop a digital solution for ToKa Fitness. ToKa Fitness currently provides customers with:

• personal training sessions

• advice about fitness training

• advice about healthy living.

The client (owner of ToKa Fitness) would like to develop a digital solution that will:

• provide information and advice about fitness training and healthy living

• provide access to digital content to support customers with their training and healthy lifestyle

• encourage existing customers to use more of the services provided by ToKa Ftness.

The client has carried out some market research with existing customers, to identify features that could be included in the digital solution. The potential features suggested by the existing customers are:

• free and paid-for content

• accessibility features for users with sight loss

• ‘social’ features

• customisable workout and eating plans.
